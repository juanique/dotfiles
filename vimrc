" An example for a vimrc file.
"
" Maintainer:	Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>
" Last change:	2002 Sep 19
"
" To use it, copy it to
"     for Unix and OS/2:  ~/.vimrc
"	      for Amiga:  s:.vimrc
"  for MS-DOS and Win32:  $VIM\_vimrc
"	    for OpenVMS:  sys$login:.vimrc
"
"
"	    The h and l keystrokes can be made to wrap over lines (so that trying
"	    to move left past the beginning of a line puts the cursor at the end
"	    of the line above). This command does that, and also allows ~ (convert
"	    case) to wrap over lines, and the cursor keys to wrap when in insert
"	    mode:
set whichwrap=h,l,~,[,]
"       The % keystroke is useful for bouncing around pairs of various sorts
"       of brackets. It can be made to work for angled brackets as well:
set matchpairs+=<:>

" When started as "evim", evim.vim will already have done these settings.
